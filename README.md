Hello! This code is free for anyone to copy and reproduce, if proper credit is given. If you do build upon this code, please share it here. I'd like to see what you come up with. Another thing to note is that this project is for me to practice my html, css, and javascript skills since I am pretty new to programming.
With that said, my code is not always the most efficient or reliable so take that as you will.
